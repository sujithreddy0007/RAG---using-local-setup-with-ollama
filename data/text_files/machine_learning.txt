Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data and improve performance without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following fixed rules, ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions or decisions based on experience. It is widely used in areas like image and speech recognition, recommendation systems, fraud detection, healthcare, and self-driving cars. ML is broadly categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. With its ability to process large datasets and adapt to changing inputs, ML plays a vital role in solving real-world problems and driving innovation.
