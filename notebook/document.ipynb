Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU.

Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.

We employ a residual connection [10] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2).

The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF2', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\attention.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\attention.pdf', 'total_pages': 11, 'format': 'PDF 1.3', 'title': 'Attention is All you Need', 'author': 'Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N.

We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations.

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [17] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout\\nWe apply dropout [27] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\n7'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF2', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\attention.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\attention.pdf', 'total_pages': 11, 'format': 'PDF 1.3', 'title': 'Attention is All you Need', 'author': 'Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\n9'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF2', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\attention.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\attention.pdf', 'total_pages': 11, 'format': 'PDF 1.3', 'title': 'Attention is All you Need', 'author': 'Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N.

They are called neural because their origins lie in the\\nMcCulloch-Pitts neuron (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943), a simpliﬁed model of the\\nbiological neuron as a kind of computing element that could be described in terms\\nof propositional logic. But the modern use in language processing no longer draws\\non these early biological inspirations.\\nInstead, a modern neural network is a network of small computing units, each\\nof which takes a vector of input values and produces a single output value. In this\\nchapter we introduce the neural net applied to classiﬁcation. The architecture we\\nintroduce is called a feedforward network because the computation proceeds iter-\\nfeedforward\\natively from one layer of units to the next. The use of modern neural nets is often\\ncalled deep learning, because modern networks are often deep (have many layers).\\ndeep learning\\nNeural networks share much of the same mathematics as logistic regression. But\\nneural networks are a more powerful classiﬁer than logistic regression, and indeed a\\nminimal neural network (technically one with a single ‘hidden layer’) can be shown\\nto learn any function.\\nNeural net classiﬁers are different from logistic regression in another way. With\\nlogistic regression, we applied the regression classiﬁer to many different tasks by\\ndeveloping many rich kinds of feature templates based on domain knowledge. When\\nworking with neural networks, it is more common to avoid most uses of rich hand-\\nderived features, instead building neural networks that take raw tokens as inputs\\nand learn to induce features as part of the process of learning to classify. We saw\\nexamples of this kind of representation learning for embeddings in Chapter 5, and\\nwe’ll see lots of examples once we start studying deep transformers networks. Nets\\nthat are very deep are particularly good at representation learning. For that reason\\ndeep neural nets are the right tool for tasks that offer sufﬁcient data to learn features\\nautomatically.\\nIn this chapter we’ll introduce feedforward networks as classiﬁers, ﬁrst with\\nhand-built features, and then using the embeddings that we studied in Chapter 5.\\nIn subsequent chapters we’ll introduce many other kinds of neural models, most\\nimportantly the transformer and attention, (Chapter 8), but also recurrent neural\\nnetworks (Chapter 13) and convolutional neural networks (Chapter 15).

A unit takes\\na set of real valued numbers as input, performs some computation on them, and\\nproduces an output.\\nAt its heart, a neural unit is taking a weighted sum of its inputs, with one addi-\\ntional term in the sum called a bias term. Given a set of inputs x1...xn, a unit has\\nbias term\\na set of corresponding weights w1...wn and a bias b, so the weighted sum z can be\\nrepresented as:\\nz = b+\\nX\\ni\\nwixi\\n(6.1)\\nOften it’s more convenient to express this weighted sum using vector notation; recall\\nfrom linear algebra that a vector is, at heart, just a list or array of numbers. Thus\\nvector\\nwe’ll talk about z in terms of a weight vector w, a scalar bias b, and an input vector\\nx, and we’ll replace the sum with the convenient dot product:\\nz = w ·x+b\\n(6.2)\\nAs deﬁned in Eq. 6.2, z is just a real valued number.\\nFinally, instead of using z, a linear function of x, as the output, neural units\\napply a non-linear function f to z. We will refer to the output of this function as\\nthe activation value for the unit, a. Since we are just modeling a single unit, the\\nactivation\\nactivation for the node is in fact the ﬁnal output of the network, which we’ll generally\\ncall y. So the value y is deﬁned as:\\ny = a = f(z)\\nWe’ll discuss three popular non-linear functions f below (the sigmoid, the tanh, and\\nthe rectiﬁed linear unit or ReLU) but it’s pedagogically convenient to start with the\\nsigmoid function since we saw it in Chapter 4:\\nsigmoid\\ny = σ(z) =\\n1\\n1+e−z\\n(6.3)\\nThe sigmoid (shown in Fig. 6.1) has a number of advantages; it maps the output\\ninto the range (0,1), which is useful in squashing outliers toward 0 or 1. And it’s\\ndifferentiable, which as we saw in Section ?? will be handy for learning.\\nFigure 6.1\\nThe sigmoid function takes a real value and maps it to the range (0,1). It is\\nnearly linear around 0 but outlier values get squashed toward 0 or 1.\\nSubstituting Eq. 6.2 into Eq. 6.3 gives us the output of a neural unit:\\ny = σ(w ·x+b) =\\n1\\n1+exp(−(w ·x+b))\\n(6.4)'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:53-07:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:53-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115053-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115053-07'00'\", 'page': 2}, page_content='6.1\\n•\\nUNITS\\n3\\nFig. 6.2 shows a ﬁnal schematic of a basic neural unit. In this example the unit\\ntakes 3 input values x1,x2, and x3, and computes a weighted sum, multiplying each\\nvalue by a weight (w1, w2, and w3, respectively), adds them to a bias term b, and then\\npasses the resulting sum through a sigmoid function to result in a number between 0\\nand 1.\\nx1\\nx2\\nx3\\ny\\nw1\\nw2\\nw3\\n∑\\nb\\nσ\\n+1\\nz\\na\\nFigure 6.2\\nA neural unit, taking 3 inputs x1, x2, and x3 (and a bias b that we represent as a\\nweight for an input clamped at +1) and producing an output y. We include some convenient\\nintermediate variables: the output of the summation, z, and the output of the sigmoid, a. In\\nthis case the output of the unit y is the same as a, but in deeper networks we’ll reserve y to\\nmean the ﬁnal output of the entire network, leaving a as the activation of an individual node.\\nLet’s walk through an example just to get an intuition. Let’s suppose we have a\\nunit with the following weight vector and bias:\\nw = [0.2,0.3,0.9]\\nb = 0.5\\nWhat would this unit do with the following input vector:\\nx = [0.5,0.6,0.1]\\nThe resulting output y would be:\\ny = σ(w ·x+b) =\\n1\\n1+e−(w·x+b) =\\n1\\n1+e−(.5∗.2+.6∗.3+.1∗.9+.5) =\\n1\\n1+e−0.87 = .70\\nIn practice, the sigmoid is not commonly used as an activation function. A function\\nthat is very similar but almost always better is the tanh function shown in Fig. 6.3a;\\ntanh\\ntanh is a variant of the sigmoid that ranges from -1 to +1:\\ny = tanh(z) = ez −e−z\\nez +e−z\\n(6.5)\\nThe simplest activation function, and perhaps the most commonly used, is the rec-\\ntiﬁed linear unit, also called the ReLU, shown in Fig. 6.3b.

These\\nweights/biases are just one from an inﬁnite number of possible sets of weights and biases that\\nwould implement the functions.\\nIt turns out, however, that it’s not possible to build a perceptron to compute\\nlogical XOR! (It’s worth spending a moment to give it a try!)\\nThe intuition behind this important result relies on understanding that a percep-\\ntron is a linear classiﬁer. For a two-dimensional input x1 and x2, the perceptron\\nequation, w1x1 +w2x2 +b = 0 is the equation of a line. (We can see this by putting\\nit in the standard linear format: x2 = (−w1/w2)x1 + (−b/w2).) This line acts as a\\ndecision boundary in two-dimensional space in which the output 0 is assigned to all\\ndecision\\nboundary\\ninputs lying on one side of the line, and the output 1 to all input points lying on the\\nother side of the line. If we had more than 2 inputs, the decision boundary becomes\\na hyperplane instead of a line, but the idea is the same, separating the space into two\\ncategories.\\nFig. 6.5 shows the possible logical inputs (00, 01, 10, and 11) and the line drawn\\nby one possible set of parameters for an AND and an OR classiﬁer. Notice that there\\nis simply no way to draw a line that separates the positive cases of XOR (01 and 10)\\nfrom the negative cases (00 and 11). We say that XOR is not a linearly separable\\nlinearly\\nseparable\\nfunction. Of course we could draw a boundary with a curve, or some other function,\\nbut not a single line.\\n6.2.1\\nThe solution: neural networks\\nWhile the XOR function cannot be calculated by a single perceptron, it can be cal-\\nculated by a layered network of perceptron units. Rather than see this with networks\\nof simple perceptrons, however, let’s see how to compute XOR using two layers of\\nReLU-based units following Goodfellow et al. (2016). Fig. 6.6 shows a ﬁgure with\\nthe input being processed by two layers of neural units. The middle layer (called\\nh) has two units, and the output layer (called y) has one unit. A set of weights and\\nbiases are shown that allows the network to correctly compute the XOR function.\\nLet’s walk through what happens with the input x = [0, 0]. If we multiply each\\ninput value by the appropriate weight, sum, and then add the bias b, we get the vector\\n[0, -1], and we then apply the rectiﬁed linear transformation to give the output of the\\nh layer as [0, 0]. Now we once again multiply by the weights, sum, and add the\\nbias (0 in this case) resulting in the value 0. The reader should work through the\\ncomputation of the remaining 3 possible input pairs to see that the resulting y values\\nare 1 for the inputs [0, 1] and [1, 0] and 0 for [0, 0] and [1, 1].'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:53-07:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:53-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115053-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115053-07'00'\", 'page': 5}, page_content='6\\nCHAPTER 6\\n•\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\nx1\\nx2\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\nx1\\nx2\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\nx1\\nx2\\na)  x1 AND x2\\nb)  x1 OR x2\\nc)  x1 XOR x2\\n?\\nFigure 6.5\\nThe functions AND, OR, and XOR, represented with input x1 on the x-axis and input x2 on the\\ny-axis.

A feedforward network is a multilayer\\nfeedforward\\nnetwork\\nnetwork in which the units are connected with no cycles; the outputs from units in\\neach layer are passed to units in the next higher layer, and no outputs are passed\\nback to lower layers. (In Chapter 13 we’ll introduce networks with cycles, called\\nrecurrent neural networks.)\\nFor historical reasons multilayer networks, especially feedforward networks, are\\nsometimes called multi-layer perceptrons (or MLPs); this is a technical misnomer,\\nmulti-layer\\nperceptrons\\nMLP\\nsince the units in modern multilayer networks aren’t perceptrons (perceptrons have a\\nsimple step-function as their activation function, but modern networks are made up\\nof units with many kinds of non-linearities like ReLUs and sigmoids), but at some\\npoint the name stuck.\\nSimple feedforward networks have three kinds of nodes: input units, hidden\\nunits, and output units.\\nFig. 6.8 shows a picture. The input layer x is a vector of simple scalar values just\\nas we saw in Fig. 6.2.\\nThe core of the neural network is the hidden layer h formed of hidden units hi,\\nhidden layer\\neach of which is a neural unit as described in Section 6.1, taking a weighted sum of\\nits inputs and then applying a non-linearity. In the standard architecture, each layer\\nis fully-connected, meaning that each unit in each layer takes as input the outputs\\nfully-connected\\nfrom all the units in the previous layer, and there is a link between every pair of units\\nfrom two adjacent layers. Thus each hidden unit sums over all the input units.\\nRecall that a single hidden unit has as parameters a weight vector and a bias. We\\nrepresent the parameters for the entire hidden layer by combining the weight vector\\nand bias for each unit i into a single weight matrix W and a single bias vector b for\\nthe whole layer (see Fig. 6.8). Each element Wji of the weight matrix W represents\\nthe weight of the connection from the ith input unit xi to the jth hidden unit hj.\\nThe advantage of using a single matrix W for the weights of the entire layer is\\nthat now the hidden layer computation for a feedforward network can be done very'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:53-07:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:53-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115053-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115053-07'00'\", 'page': 7}, page_content='8\\nCHAPTER 6\\n•\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\nx1\\nx2\\nxn0\\n…\\n…\\n+1\\nb\\n…\\nU\\nW\\ninput layer\\nhidden layer\\noutput layer\\nh1\\ny1\\ny2\\nyn2\\nh2\\nh3\\nhn1\\nFigure 6.8\\nA simple 2-layer feedforward network, with one hidden layer, one output layer,\\nand one input layer (the input layer is usually not counted when enumerating layers).\\nefﬁciently with simple matrix operations. In fact, the computation only has three\\nsteps: multiplying the weight matrix by the input vector x, adding the bias vector b,\\nand applying the activation function g (such as the sigmoid, tanh, or ReLU activation\\nfunction deﬁned above).\\nThe output of the hidden layer, the vector h, is thus the following (for this exam-\\nple we’ll use the sigmoid function σ as our activation function):\\nh = σ(Wx+b)\\n(6.8)\\nNotice that we’re applying the σ function here to a vector, while in Eq. 6.3 it was\\napplied to a scalar. We’re thus allowing σ(·), and indeed any activation function\\ng(·), to apply to a vector element-wise, so g[z1,z2,z3] = [g(z1),g(z2),g(z3)].\\nLet’s introduce some constants to represent the dimensionalities of these vectors\\nand matrices. We’ll refer to the input layer as layer 0 of the network, and have\\nn0 represent the number of inputs, so x is a vector of real numbers of dimension\\nn0, or more formally x ∈Rn0, a column vector of dimensionality [n0 × 1]. Let’s\\ncall the hidden layer layer 1 and the output layer layer 2. The hidden layer has\\ndimensionality n1, so h ∈Rn1 and also b ∈Rn1 (since each hidden unit can take a\\ndifferent bias value).

The role of the output layer is to take\\nthis new representation h and compute a ﬁnal output. This output could be a real-\\nvalued number, but in many cases the goal of the network is to make some sort of\\nclassiﬁcation decision, and so we will focus on the case of classiﬁcation.\\nIf we are doing a binary task like sentiment classiﬁcation, we might have a sin-\\ngle output node, and its scalar value y is the probability of positive versus negative\\nsentiment. If we are doing multinomial classiﬁcation, such as assigning a part-of-\\nspeech tag, we might have one output node for each potential part-of-speech, whose\\noutput value is the probability of that part-of-speech, and the values of all the output\\nnodes must sum to one.

Like the hidden layer, the output layer has a weight\\nmatrix (let’s call it U), but some models don’t include a bias vector b in the output\\nlayer, so we’ll simplify by eliminating the bias vector in this example. The weight\\nmatrix is multiplied by its input vector (h) to produce the intermediate output z:\\nz = Uh\\nThere are n2 output nodes, so z ∈Rn2, weight matrix U has dimensionality U ∈\\nRn2×n1, and element Ui j is the weight from unit j in the hidden layer to unit i in the\\noutput layer.\\nHowever, z can’t be the output of the classiﬁer, since it’s a vector of real-valued\\nnumbers, while what we need for classiﬁcation is a vector of probabilities.

By contrast, in Chapter 4 the features were mainly designed by hand\\nvia feature templates.

Like them,\\nwe’ll take hand-built features, pass them through a classiﬁer, and produce a class\\nprobability. The only difference is that we’ll use a neural network instead of logistic\\nregression as the classiﬁer.\\n6.4.1\\nNeural net classiﬁers with hand-built features\\nLet’s begin with a simple 2-layer sentiment classiﬁer by taking our logistic regres-\\nsion classiﬁer from Chapter 4, which corresponds to a 1-layer network, and just\\nadding a hidden layer. The input element xi can be scalar features like those in\\nFig. ??, e.g., x1 = count(words ∈doc), x2 = count(positive lexicon words ∈doc),\\nx3 = 1 if “no” ∈doc, and so on, for a total of d features. And the output layer\\nˆy could have two nodes (one each for positive and negative), or 3 nodes (positive,\\nnegative, neutral), in which case ˆy1 would be the estimated probability of positive\\nsentiment, ˆy2 the probability of negative and ˆy3 the probability of neutral. The re-\\nsulting equations would be just what we saw above for a 2-layer network (as always,\\nwe’ll continue to use the σ to stand for any non-linearity, whether sigmoid, ReLU\\nor other).\\nx = [x1,x2,...xd]\\n(each xi is a hand-designed feature)\\nh = σ(Wx+b)\\nz = Uh\\nˆy = softmax(z)\\n(6.19)\\nFig. 6.10 shows a sketch of this architecture.

We do this by vectorizing the\\nprocess, just as we saw with logistic regression; instead of using for-loops to go\\nthrough each example, we’ll use matrix multiplication to do the entire computation\\nof an entire test set at once. First, we pack all the input feature vectors for each input\\nx into a single input matrix X, with each row i a row vector consisting of the features\\nfor input example x(i) (i.e., the vector x(i)). If the dimensionality of our input feature\\nvector is d, X will be a matrix of shape [m×d].\\nBecause we are now modeling each input as a row vector rather than a column\\nvector, we also need to slightly modify Eq. 6.19. X is of shape [m×d] and W is of\\nshape [dh ×d], so we’ll reorder how we multiply X and W and transpose W so they\\ncorrectly multiply to yield a matrix H of shape [m×dh]. 1\\nThe bias vector b from Eq. 6.19 of shape [1×dh] will now have to be replicated\\ninto a matrix of shape [m × dh]. We’ll need to similarly reorder the next step and\\ntranspose U. Finally, our output matrix ˆY will be of shape [m × 3] (or more gen-\\nerally [m × do], where do is the number of output classes), with each row i of our\\noutput matrix ˆY consisting of the output vector ˆy(i). Here are the ﬁnal equations for\\ncomputing the output class distribution for an entire test set:\\nH = σ(XW⊺+b)\\nZ = HU⊺\\nˆY = softmax(Z)\\n(6.20)\\nIn this book, we’ll sometimes see orderings like WX + b and sometimes XW + b.\\nThat’s why it’s always important to be very aware of the shapes of your weight\\nmatrices participating in any given equation.\\n6.5\\nEmbeddings as the input to neural net classiﬁers\\nWhile hand-built features are a traditional way to design classiﬁers, most applica-\\ntions of neural networks for NLP don’t use hand-built human-engineered features as\\ninputs. Instead, we draw on deep learning’s ability to learn features from the data by\\nrepresenting tokens as embeddings. For this section we’ll represent each token by\\nits static word2vec or GloVe embeddings that we saw how to compute in Chapter 5.\\nBy static embedding, we mean that each token is represented by a ﬁxed vector that\\nwe train once, and then just put into a big dictionary. When we want to refer to that\\ntoken, we grab its embedding out of the dictionary.\\nHowever when we apply neural models to the task of language modeling (as\\nwe’ll see in Chapter 8) the situation is more complex, and we’ll use a more power-\\nful kind of embedding called a contextual embedding. Contextual embeddings are\\ndifferent for each time a word occurs in a different context. Furthermore, we’ll have\\nthe network learn these embeddings as part of the task of word prediction.\\nSo let’s explore the text classiﬁcation domain above, but using static embeddings\\nas features instead of the hand-designed features. Let’s focus on the inference stage,\\n1\\nNote that we could have kept the original order of our products if we had instead made our input\\nmatrix X represent each input as a column vector instead of a row vector, making it of shape [d ×m].

An embed-\\nding is a vector of dimension d that represents the input token. The dictionary of\\nstatic embeddings in which we store these embeddings is the embedding matrix\\nembedding\\nmatrix\\nE. Each row of the embedding matrix represents each token of the vocabulary V\\nas a (row) vector of dimensionality d. Since E has a row for each of the |V| to-\\nkens in the vocabulary, E has shape [|V|×d]. This embedding matrix E plays a role\\nwhenever we are using embeddings as input to neural NLP systems, including in the\\ntransformer-based large language models we will introduce over the next chapters.\\nGiven an input token string like dessert was great we ﬁrst convert the tokens\\ninto vocabulary indices (these were created when we ﬁrst tokenized the input using\\nBPE or SentencePiece).

Next we use indexing to select the corresponding rows from E\\n(row 3, row 4000, row 10532).\\nAnother way to think about selecting token embeddings from the embedding\\nmatrix is to represent input tokens as one-hot vectors of shape [1 × |V|], i.e., with\\none dimension for each word in the vocabulary. Recall that in a one-hot vector all\\none-hot vector\\nthe elements are 0 except one, the element whose dimension is the word’s index\\nin the vocabulary, which has value 1.

Let’s give an example of each: pooling for the sentiment task,\\nand concatenation for the language modeling task.\\nPooling input embeddings for sentiment\\nSo let’s begin with seeing how pooling\\ncan work for the sentiment classiﬁcation task. The intuition of pooling is that for\\nsentiment, the exact position of the input (is some word like great the ﬁrst word?\\nthe second word?) is less important than the identity of the word itself.\\nA pooling function is a way to turn a set of embeddings into a single embedding.\\nFor example, for a text with N input words/tokens w1,...,wN, we want to turn\\nthe N row embeddings e(w1),...,e(wN) (each of dimensionality d) into a single\\nembedding also of dimensionality d.\\nThere are various ways to pool. The simplest is mean-pooling: taking the mean\\nmean-pooling\\nby summing the embeddings and then dividing by N:\\nxmean = 1\\nN\\nN\\nX\\ni=1\\ne(wi)\\n(6.21)\\nHere are the equations for this classiﬁer assuming mean pooling:\\nx = mean(e(w1),e(w2),...,e(wn))\\nh = σ(xW +b)\\nz = hU\\nˆy = softmax(z)\\n(6.22)\\nThe architecture is sketched in Fig. 6.13, where we also give the shapes for all the\\nrelevant matrices.\\nThere are many other options for pooling, like max-pooling, in which case for\\nmax-pooling\\neach dimension we take the element-wise max over all the inputs. The element-wise\\nmax of a set of N vectors is a new vector whose kth element is the max of the kth\\nelements of all the N vectors.\\nConcatenating input embeddings for language modeling\\nFor sentiment analy-\\nsis we saw how to generate an output vector with probabilities over three classes:\\npositive, negative, or neutral, given as input a window of N input tokens, by ﬁrst\\npooling those token embeddings into a single embedding vector.\\nNow let’s consider language modeling: predicting upcoming words from prior\\nwords. In this task we are given the same window of N input tokens, but our task\\nnow is to predict the next token that should follow the window. We’ll sketch a\\nsimple feedforward neural language model, drawing on an algorithm ﬁrst introduced\\nby Bengio et al. (2003). The feedforward language model introduces many of the\\nimportant concepts of large language modeling that we will return to in Chapter 7\\nand Chapter 8.\\nNeural language models have many advantages over the n-gram language mod-\\nels of Chapter 3.

Let’s\\nassume we’re doing hard classiﬁcation, where only one class is the correct one.\\nThe true label y is then a vector with K elements, each corresponding to a class,\\nwith yc = 1 if the correct class is c, with all other elements of y being 0. Recall that\\na vector like this, with one value equal to 1 and the rest 0, is called a one-hot vector.\\nAnd our classiﬁer will produce an estimate vector with K elements ˆy, each element\\nˆyk of which represents the estimated probability p(yk = 1|x).\\nThe loss function for a single example x is the negative sum of the logs of the K\\noutput classes, each weighted by their probability yk:\\nLCE(ˆy,y) = −\\nK\\nX\\nk=1\\nyk log ˆyk\\n(6.26)\\nWe can simplify this equation further; let’s ﬁrst rewrite the equation using the func-\\ntion 1{} which evaluates to 1 if the condition in the brackets is true and to 0 oth-\\nerwise. This makes it more obvious that the terms in the sum in Eq. 6.26 will be 0\\nexcept for the term corresponding to the true class for which yk = 1:\\nLCE(ˆy,y) = −\\nK\\nX\\nk=1\\n1{yk = 1}log ˆyk\\nIn other words, the cross-entropy loss is simply the negative log of the output proba-\\nbility corresponding to the correct class, and we therefore also call this the negative\\nlog likelihood loss:\\nnegative log\\nlikelihood loss\\nLCE(ˆy,y) = −log ˆyc\\n(where c is the correct class)\\n(6.27)\\nPlugging in the softmax formula from Eq. 6.9, and with K the number of classes:\\nLCE(ˆy,y) = −log\\nexp(zc)\\nPK\\nj=1 exp(z j)\\n(where c is the correct class)\\n(6.28)\\nLet’s think about the negative log probability as a loss function. A perfect clas-\\nsiﬁer would assign the correct class i probability 1 and all the incorrect classes prob-\\nability 0. That means the higher p(ˆyi) (the closer it is to 1), the better the classiﬁer;\\np(ˆyi) is (the closer it is to 0), the worse the classiﬁer. The negative log of this prob-\\nability is a beautiful loss metric since it goes from 0 (negative log of 1, no loss)\\nto inﬁnity (negative log of 0, inﬁnite loss). This loss function also insures that as\\nprobability of the correct answer is maximized, the probability of all the incorrect\\nanswers is minimized; since they all sum to one, any increase in the probability of\\nthe correct answer is coming at the expense of the incorrect answers.\\nThe number K of classes of the output vector ˆy can be small or large. Perhaps\\nour task is 3-way sentiment, and then the classes might be positive, negative, and\\nneutral. Or if our task is deciding the part of speech of a word (i.e., whether it is a\\nnoun or verb or adjective, etc.), then K is set of possible parts of speech in our tagset\\n(of which there are 17 in the tagset we will deﬁne in Chapter 17). And if our task\\nis language modeling, and our classiﬁer is trying to predict which word is next, then\\nour set of classes is the set of words, which might be 50,000 or 100,000.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:53-07:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:53-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115053-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115053-07'00'\", 'page': 19}, page_content='20\\nCHAPTER 6\\n•\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\n6.6.2\\nComputing the Gradient\\nHow do we compute the gradient of this loss function?

While backprop was invented spe-\\nerror back-\\npropagation\\ncially for neural networks, it turns out to be the same as a more general procedure\\ncalled backward differentiation, which depends on the notion of computation\\ngraphs.

In this\\nexample our goal is to compute the derivative of the output function L with respect\\nto each of the input variables, i.e., ∂L\\n∂a, ∂L\\n∂b, and ∂L\\n∂c . The derivative ∂L\\n∂a tells us how\\nmuch a small change in a affects L.\\nBackwards differentiation makes use of the chain rule in calculus, so let’s re-\\nchain rule\\nmind ourselves of that. Suppose we are computing the derivative of a composite\\nfunction f(x) = u(v(x)). The derivative of f(x) is the derivative of u(x) with respect\\nto v(x) times the derivative of v(x) with respect to x:\\nd f\\ndx = du\\ndv · dv\\ndx\\n(6.31)\\nThe chain rule extends to more than two functions.

Fig. 6.16 shows part of the backward computation\\nat one node e. Each node takes an upstream gradient that is passed in from its parent\\nnode to the right, and for each of its inputs computes a local gradient (the gradient\\nof its output with respect to its input), and uses the chain rule to multiply these two\\nto compute a downstream gradient to be passed on to the next earlier node.\\nLet’s now compute the 3 derivatives we need.

In neural networks, by contrast, we need to initialize the\\nweights with small random numbers. It’s also helpful to normalize the input values\\nto have 0 mean and unit variance.\\nVarious forms of regularization are used to prevent overﬁtting. One of the most\\nimportant is dropout: randomly dropping some units and their connections from\\ndropout\\nthe network during training (Hinton et al. 2012, Srivastava et al. 2014). At each\\niteration of training (whenever we update parameters, i.e. each mini-batch if we are\\nusing mini-batch gradient descent), we repeatedly choose a probability p and for\\neach unit we replace its output with zero with probability p (and renormalize the\\nrest of the outputs from that layer).\\nTuning of hyperparameters is also important. The parameters of a neural net-\\nhyperparameter\\nwork are the weights W and biases b; those are learned by gradient descent. The\\nhyperparameters are things that are chosen by the algorithm designer; optimal val-\\nues are tuned on a devset rather than by gradient descent learning on the training\\nset. Hyperparameters include the learning rate η, the mini-batch size, the model\\narchitecture (the number of layers, the number of hidden nodes per layer, the choice\\nof activation functions), how to regularize, and so on. Gradient descent itself also\\nhas many architectural variants such as Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015).\\nFinally, most modern neural networks are built using computation graph for-\\nmalisms that make it easy and natural to do gradient computation and parallelization\\non vector-based GPUs (Graphic Processing Units). PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017)\\nand TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015) are two of the most popular. The interested\\nreader should consult a neural network textbook for further details; some sugges-\\ntions are at the end of the chapter.\\n6.7\\nSummary\\n• Neural networks are built out of neural units, originally inspired by biological\\nneurons but now simply an abstract computational device.\\n• Each neural unit multiplies input values by a weight vector, adds a bias, and\\nthen applies a non-linear activation function like sigmoid, tanh, or rectiﬁed\\nlinear unit.\\n• In a fully-connected, feedforward network, each unit in layer i is connected\\nto each unit in layer i+1, and there are no cycles.\\n• The power of neural networks comes from the ability of early layers to learn\\nrepresentations that can be utilized by later layers in the network.\\n• Neural networks are trained by optimization algorithms like gradient de-\\nscent.\\n• Error backpropagation, backward differentiation on a computation graph,\\nis used to compute the gradients of the loss function for a network.\\n• Neural language models use a neural network as a probabilistic classiﬁer, to\\ncompute the probability of the next word given the previous n words.\\n• Neural language models can use pretrained embeddings, or can learn embed-\\ndings from scratch in the process of language modeling.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref', 'creationdate': '2025-08-24T11:50:53-07:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\embeddings.pdf', 'total_pages': 27, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2025-08-24T11:50:53-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20250824115053-07'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20250824115053-07'00'\", 'page': 25}, page_content='26\\nCHAPTER 6\\n•\\nNEURAL NETWORKS\\nHistorical Notes\\nThe origins of neural networks lie in the 1940s McCulloch-Pitts neuron (McCul-\\nloch and Pitts, 1943), a simpliﬁed model of the biological neuron as a kind of com-\\nputing element that could be described in terms of propositional logic. By the late\\n1950s and early 1960s, a number of labs (including Frank Rosenblatt at Cornell and\\nBernard Widrow at Stanford) developed research into neural networks; this phase\\nsaw the development of the perceptron (Rosenblatt, 1958), and the transformation\\nof the threshold into a bias, a notation we still use (Widrow and Hoff, 1960).\\nThe ﬁeld of neural networks declined after it was shown that a single perceptron\\nunit was unable to model functions as simple as XOR (Minsky and Papert, 1969).\\nWhile some small amount of work continued during the next two decades, a major\\nrevival for the ﬁeld didn’t come until the 1980s, when practical tools for building\\ndeeper networks like error backpropagation became widespread (Rumelhart et al.,\\n1986). During the 1980s a wide variety of neural network and related architec-\\ntures were developed, particularly for applications in psychology and cognitive sci-\\nence (Rumelhart and McClelland 1986b, McClelland and Elman 1986, Rumelhart\\nand McClelland 1986a, Elman 1990), for which the term connectionist or paral-\\nconnectionist\\nlel distributed processing was often used (Feldman and Ballard 1982, Smolensky\\n1988). Many of the principles and techniques developed in this period are foun-\\ndational to modern work, including the ideas of distributed representations (Hinton,\\n1986), recurrent networks (Elman, 1990), and the use of tensors for compositionality\\n(Smolensky, 1990).\\nBy the 1990s larger neural networks began to be applied to many practical lan-\\nguage processing tasks as well, like handwriting recognition (LeCun et al. 1989) and\\nspeech recognition (Morgan and Bourlard 1990). By the early 2000s, improvements\\nin computer hardware and advances in optimization and training techniques made it\\npossible to train even larger and deeper networks, leading to the modern term deep\\nlearning (Hinton et al. 2006, Bengio et al. 2007). We cover more related history in\\nChapter 13 and Chapter 15.\\nThere are a number of excellent books on neural networks, including Goodfellow\\net al.
